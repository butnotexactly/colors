## Usage

Save the [html file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/butnotexactly/colors/master/colors.html) (optionally to your Dropbox, repository, USB drive or cloud folder).

### To add colors:
Open the file in a text editor (Notepad, Sublime Text) and add colors or palettes in the provided space. The syntax is extremely simple; brackets for a palette, a hexcode for a color. Comments and blank lines are fine too and will be ignored.

```

#ecf0f1
#3498db
#2980b9
```

### To view or use colors:
Double-click the file to open it in your default browser. Click a color to copy it automatically, or a palette name to copy every color separated by a line.

## Why?

* Easy to edit; just open the html file in a text editor and add a few colors in the provided space, save and reload
* Lightweight, offline and portable â€” it's a single file, and easily be placed in Dropbox or Git or on any device
* Perfect for quickly referencing colors (click a color->copy color, click a title->copy all the colors)
* Doesn't require another app or service (you can just open it in browser to read from or a text editor to edit)

## Can it read or write files automatically or sync to a server?

No, it's a single, offline static HTML file without any read or write access.
